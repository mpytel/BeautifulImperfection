# Strategic Harmony in Beautiful Imperfection

This guide explains how harmony works in Beautiful Imperfection and provides strategies for achieving balance as you progress through levels.

## How Harmony is Calculated

Harmony is the central mechanic that determines progress in the game. It's calculated as a score from 0-100% based on several key factors:

### Diversity Factor (75% weight)
- Measures how well your structure balances elements with different love/logic ratios
- Ideal distribution: ~40% love-dominant elements (>60% love), ~40% logic-dominant elements (<40% love), and ~20% balanced elements
- Having both love and logic represented is essential - missing either type severely reduces harmony
- Visual indicator: Orange elements indicate love-dominant, blue shows logic-dominant, green shows balanced

### Connection Factor (15% weight)
- Evaluates how well elements are connected to each other
- Optimal connection ratio is around 0.6 (not too sparse, not too dense)
- Too few or too many connections reduce harmony
- Purple lines indicate connections between elements

### Evolution Factor (10% weight)
- Assesses how balanced the evolution levels are across elements
- Highest when the average evolution level is around 2.5
- Large variations in evolution levels between elements create disharmony
- Higher evolution levels display more complex fractal patterns

### Disharmony Reduction
Several factors can reduce overall harmony:
- Variance in evolution levels (50% weight)
- Level factor (50% weight) - higher levels have more potential for disharmony

## Level Progression and Targets

### Target Calculation
- Each level has a target harmony percentage that must be reached to advance
- The difficulty slider (1-10) affects the target:
  - **No Target** (â‰¤2): 0% target
  - **Easy** (2-4): 30-40% base target
  - **Normal** (5-8): 40-50% base target
  - **Hard** (9-10): 50-60% base target
- Targets increase with level progression
- Small variations are added based on level number
- Level 1 always has no target, allowing free experimentation

### Level Advancement
When a player reaches the target harmony and clicks "COMPLETE":
- The current structure is saved as an image
- The player receives bonus points based on how much they exceeded the target
- The game advances to the next level
- The previous level's structure becomes embedded in the new level's elements

## Gameplay Strategies for Harmony

To achieve harmony, players should:

### 1. Create Diverse Love/Logic Distribution
- Aim for approximately 40% love-dominant elements (>60% love)
- Aim for approximately 40% logic-dominant elements (<40% love)
- Include some balanced elements (40-60% love) for stability
- Use UP/DOWN arrow keys to adjust individual elements
- Watch the color gradient: orange indicates love-dominant, blue shows logic-dominant, green shows balanced
- Ensure both love and logic are represented in your structure

### 2. Create Optimal Connections
- Connect approximately 60% of the possible connections between elements
- Avoid both sparse structures (too few connections) and dense structures (too many connections)
- Strategic placement of connections matters more than quantity
- Consider creating patterns like triangles, squares, or stars rather than connecting everything

### 3. Evolve Elements Thoughtfully
- Aim for an average evolution level around 2.5
- Distribute evolution levels evenly rather than having some highly evolved and others basic
- Use the SPACE key to evolve selected elements
- Consider evolving elements that have more connections first

### 4. Consider Shape Variety
- Use the S key to change element shapes for visual variety
- Different shapes can create more aesthetically pleasing structures
- Try to match shapes with their function in the structure

### 5. Use Strategic Hints
- Pay attention to the hint box at the bottom of the screen
- It provides specific guidance on what aspect needs the most improvement

## Level-to-Level Experience

As players progress through levels:

### Increasing Complexity
- Higher levels incorporate structures from previous levels
- More elements are introduced with each level
- The arrangement pattern is influenced by the love/logic balance of the previous level

### Preservation of Detail
- Lower-level structures maintain their visual properties in higher levels
- Colors, shapes, and connections from previous levels remain visible
- This creates a true fractal experience where patterns repeat at different scales

### Adaptive Difficulty
- Higher levels have higher base targets
- The disharmony factor increases with level, making perfect harmony harder to achieve
- Players need to be more precise with their diversity at higher levels

### Scoring and Bonuses
- Exceeding the target harmony provides bonus points
- Higher levels offer larger potential bonuses
- The score accumulates across levels

## Advanced Harmony Techniques

### Child Elements
- Use the C key to create child elements from selected elements
- Children inherit properties from their parents with slight variations
- Strategic placement of child elements can help balance the overall structure

### Shape Selection
- Different shapes have subtle effects on visual harmony
- Circles and hexagons tend to create more flowing structures
- Squares and triangles create more rigid, logical structures
- Hearts and stars can add focal points to your structure

### Fractal Thinking
- Remember that each level becomes part of the next
- Plan your structures with future levels in mind
- A well-balanced lower level creates a better foundation for higher levels

## Philosophical Connections

Beautiful Imperfection's harmony system reflects its core philosophy:

- **Life is love or logic**: The balance between these forces creates harmony
- **Steps for perfection**: Proof (creating connections) then modify (adjusting balance)
- **Finding miracles in the ordinary**: The beauty emerges from the careful balance of simple elements

By understanding and applying these harmony principles, you'll create increasingly complex and beautiful fractal structures as you progress through the game.
